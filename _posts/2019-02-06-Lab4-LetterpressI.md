For today's lab you will set as much as possible of the following poem, which was widely reprinted in nineteenth-century newspapers. This version appeared in the *Winchester Home Journal on May 6, 1858.

*A Printer’s Epitaph*

Here lies a *form*, place no *imposing stone*  
To mark the *head*, where weary it is lain,  
Tis *matter dead*, its mission being done,  
To be *distributed* to dust again.  
The body is but the *Type*, at best, of man,  
Whose *impress* is the spirit’s deathless *page*;  
Worn out, the *type* is thrown to *pi* again,  
The *impression* lives through an eternal age.

In your lab report this week, you could use this as a launching point for thinking about the materiality of print culture. How does recognizing text as composed—quite literally—of material letter sorts, spaces, and leading refigure our view of print culture? How does this form of textual production and labor relate to other modes we have studied? And how might it reshape our understanding of the artifacts produced through these media?
